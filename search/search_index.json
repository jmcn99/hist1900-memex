Misinformation has been a common theme within all different types of communication, and has risen greatly with the development of the internet.</p> <p>The story begins with book consistency. Before the internet, including telegrams, etc, books were the primary form of information transfer. Regarding the definition of a book, a book can be represented as a piece of literature, or possibly a verbal transfer of a story. Therefore, for a book to be passed to you, it had to have been written by someone. In this time, you could not recieve information from someone in a different continent from you. If you were to seek information about a certain topic, you would seek out someone knowledgable about this topic. It was common that the person you would seek out would be an expert, and credible about the information you are searching for. </p> <p>However, books were also a source of knowledge, rather than seeking knowledge from a person themselves. If you were to study a topic, it would likely be through a book. data integrity was a common cause of misinformation within these books. How are you to know that the book you are actively reading is the book you are intending to read? How are you to know that the person who wrote the book is a credible author? These are all questions that without an answer, can cause the spread of misinformation. </p> <p>In times like these, the amount of information of available was small. This brings to rise the main issues of these times, which was misinformation often being taken as true, for the sole reason that it was often times the only information available. The professor who ran the @bookLab gave a great argument about the ambiguity of books. A piece of information within a book may be correct, but it could be understood by a reader as something different than the author was intending. Now, if a reader were to pass on this information, say by rewriting the knowledge, or verbally passing it to another, there has now been a spread of misinformation, which can be spread even further by the people who recieved this knowledge.</p> <p>Now, moving further down the line of technological advancement, we reach the era of fax machines. @coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015 explained the issue of data integrity with regards to this method of communication. The author gave examples of how fax machine would occasionally mess up letters, such that \"\u2018Mother-in-law dead hurry\u2019 will be altered to \u2018Mother-in-law dead Hurray,\u2019 or something like that\". Thus, misinformation was spread. </p> <p>However, much of this misinformation spread was unintentional. This changed with the rise of the internet, and digital privacy. </p> <p>With the rise of digital privacy, specifically pseudonyms, misinformation began to spread more intentionally. While it was not the case that misinformation was never spread intentionally before this, it was a lot more difficult, as people knew where the information was coming from, and if it was found that a person was spreading misinformation, there could be concequences. Now, spreading misinformation is a common occurance on the internet. </p> <p>pseudonyms allow for a user on a website to hide their identity under a different name, with many websites making minimal other information public to other users on the site. This means that there is a different sense of free speech, this sense being that anyone can say what they want without it being tied to their physical identity. Therefore, there was a the rise of social media and the rise of misinformation. </p> <p>The author of the article @publisher11EvolutionInternet2016 said that with the rise of current social media websites, \u201cwe can consider the opinions of complete strangers who may never write in traditional print;\u201d (Publisher, 2016, p. 1). Thus explaining that strangers who would not dare to write in traditional print, now will write publicly because there identity can be concealed. As such, not only has the amount of misinformation spread, the extent to which the information is incorrect has greatly increased. Spreading potentially harmful information is something that is now extremely common, as there is little to no concequences for doing so. </p> <p>And so, through this information, I have come to realize the importance of understanding the spread of misinformation and how it has changed, and now have more respect for taking everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt. With the sheer mass amounts of information available, it is easy to see how misinformation can be spread, and the harm that it can cause. The evolution of the internet has changed how misinformation has spread, and the type of misinformation that is spreading, as well as the outcome when recieving misinformation.</p> <p>And who knows, maybe this is misinformation I'm spreading to you (its not) :) </p>"},{"location":"0_Final_Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"0_Final_Journey_2/#the-journey-between-bushwemaythink1945-and-publisher11evolutioninternet2016","title":"The Journey Between \"@bushWeMayThink1945\" and \"publisher11EvolutionInternet2016\"","text":"<ul> <li>@bushWeMayThink1945</li> <li>envisioning new technologies</li> <li>new opportunities</li> <li>recent technologies quickly became obsolete</li> <li>dotcom crash</li> <li>@publisher11EvolutionInternet2016</li> </ul> <p>Within this course, my main goal was to simply get a history of the internet. I am a computer science student, so understanding how the internet was developed and became how it is today was a very intriguing topic to me. However, what I didn't expect, was the very historical approach to teaching this history. As a CS student, I was expecting a technical explanation of the internet, likely from when the time period in which the internet was being developed. I ended up gaining a different history of the internet, begining with things that were seemingly completely unrelated to the internet I know today.</p> <p>One of the first papers I read in this class was @bushWeMayThink1945. This paper a summary of the author Vannevar Bush envisioning new technologies in different fields, explaining why they may be needed and how current technologies can be improved. This was in a time where most of the technological innovations were within the field of war. He argues that men need to move away from technologies of war, and begin developing tools that can strengthen the mind. Bush covered a broad range of topics, predicting things like smaller cameras that can be attached to your head, advanced artihmetic machines, and logic machines. I came to the realization that without individuals like Bush, technology may not have been pushed to the point where the internet would have been possible. Then, I understood that the history of the internet was much deeper than just its technological development. </p> <p>Once technology started becoming more mainstream, like Vannevar Bush predicted, the product lifecycle became much quicker, and recent technologies quickly became obsolete. This trend was something that really interested me, and was very important to the recent development of the internet, as well as other technologies. Instead of humanity holding on to one technology for many years, they began phasing out of sight very quickly. @coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015 explained this in terms of the fax machine, stating that \u201csuch proponents and observers hailed fax as a 'coming wonder' in the 1930s, a 'Cinderella' in the 1940s, a 'commercial infant' in the 1950s, a 'sleeping giant' in the 1960s, and an 'aged infant' in the 1970s.\u201d (Coopersmith, 2015, p. 17). This is a lifecycle of a mere 40 years. During the @bookLab, the professor mentioned that scrolls were used for more than 4000 years, which is a 100x decrease in lifespan between two technologies, which were used for similar purposes, in this case being communication. </p> <p>After researcch on this subject, it was clear to me that this decrease in technologies lifetimes was a critical part in the history of the internet. Paired with the relative ease to create new technologies, such as Gopher (@driscollBirthModemWorld2022), relatively new technologies would be taken over by even newer technologies, that would again by quickly taken over by technologies that improved upon these. Thus, the lifecycle of the internet was created. </p> <p>The decrease in a techologies lifetime was just one important piece of history that I felt completely related to my goal in learning the history of the internet. However, there are many more pieces of knowledge that I gained in this course that also contributed to my goal. For example, learning about the history of punch cards was very intriguing to me, and was the first part of this course which really made me understand why we were taking such a historical approach when learning about a relatively new concept, being the internet. I began understanding how so many different points in history that are seemingly unrelated to the current internet had their own purpose in pushing technology to the point where the internet became a possibility, and without each of these points, the internet would not have been created.</p> <p>The 3rd part of this course was where I really achieved my goal of understanding the history of the internet. As interesting and important the historical aspect of the course was, the point in which we started focusing on more current aspects of the internet was extremely interesting to me. Learning about not just how the internet came to existence, but rather the points in its history that allowed it to become how it is today, was what I really wanted to get out of this course.</p> <p>I was able to apply what I had learned before to the events that happened in the history of the current internet to better understand how and why these events occured, and how they changed the course of the internets development. </p> <p>For example, the dotcom crash was a significant event in the development of the internet, possibly even the most significant. Using my previous knowledge of the history of the internet, and trends that caused it to be developed, I was able to relate the dotcom crash to the trend of recent technologies quickly became obsolete. This ability to relate historical events and trends to current trends and events on the internet was what really allowed me to achieve my goal in this class. I now can understand certain trends on the internet, such as social media trends explained by @publisher11EvolutionInternet2016, and relate them to other events in history unrelated to the internet, overall giving me a better understanding of the internet and its history. </p>"},{"location":"annotations/my%20extracted%20annotations%20for%20%40AnotomyAISystem/","title":"my extracted annotations for @AnotomyAISystem","text":"<p>A brief command and a response is the most common form of engagement with this consumer voice-enabled AI device.

Books serve as a tool for preserving and transmitting knowledge, culture, and values from one generation to the next. They provide a space for people to explore different perspectives, question assumptions, and expand their understanding of the world.</p> <p>In this sense, a book can be seen as a window into the human experience, offering insights into our collective history, our shared hopes and fears, and our attempts to make sense of the world. Whether in the form of works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, or any other genre, books provide a space for us to engage with the world on a deep and meaningful level, to challenge our own beliefs and assumptions, and to discover new and previously unconsidered possibilities.</p> <p>Ultimately, the meaning and significance of a book can only be determined by the reader and the context in which it is read. A book may contain a single, definitive message, or it may hold many possible interpretations, each of which may be shaped by the reader's own experiences, beliefs, and cultural background. In this way, a book can be seen as a collaborative creation between the author and the reader, each of whom bring their own unique perspectives to the work, enriching its meaning and significance.</p>"},{"location":"atomic_notes/the%20definition%20of%20a%20book/#citational-information","title":"Citational Information","text":"<p>@bookLab</p>"},{"location":"atomic_notes/the%20definition%20of%20a%20book/#related-links","title":"Related Links","text":"<p>recent technologies quickly became obsolete</p>"},{"location":"atomic_notes/the%20rise%20of%20social%20media%20and%20the%20rise%20of%20misinformation/","title":"The rise of social media and the rise of misinformation","text":"<p>tags:: #social-media #privacy #information projects::hist1900-memex/docs/source_notes/@publisher11EvolutionInternet2016</p> <p>With the rise of social media, the rise of misinformation came as well.
