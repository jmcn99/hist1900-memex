### Summary & Key Take Aways

In As We May Think, Vannevar Bush envissioned many improvements to technology as well as new technological devices. He begins by explaining the need for men of science to move away from technologies of war, and begin developing tools and devices to strengthen the mind. In addition to technologies of war, he explains in a broader sense that during the time that this was being written, science has brought instruments which empower a user in the physical sense. "They have improved his cfood, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence" (Bush, 22). 

Bush covers broad topics, ranging from photography to the memex. Regarding these topics, Bush envisions new technologies that could emmerge, and turned out to be very accurate.
