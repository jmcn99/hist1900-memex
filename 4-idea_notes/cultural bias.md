>“It is doubtful if any non-American could have prevailed against Morse.” (Coopersmith, 2015, p. 26)

Why is it the case that no non-American could have prevailed against Morse? Did he have a significant backing from the government for his technology?

This makes me think about how if this cultural bias didn't exist, and countries were more accepting of adopting foreign technologies, what further advancements could we have made a species?
