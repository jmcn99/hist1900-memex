It is becoming a trend that newer technology quickly becomes obsolete. I believe since technology is becoming such a huge bussiness, specificially the sale of new technology, that there is large motivation from big companies to create new tech, making their old tech, which is not actually that old, obsolete. This would be in hopes of selling 'the latest model', with 'the newest features'. 

During the [[@bookLab]], the professor mentioned that scrolls were used for over 4000 years, before they were eventually replaced by the codex, at least in a western society. This is much longer than the Fax machines' mere 50 years of popularity.

“Such proponents and observers hailed fax as a “coming wonder” in the 1930s, a “Cinderella” in the 1940s, a “commercial infant” in the 1950s, a “sleeping giant” in the 1960s, and an “aged infant” in the 1970s.” (Coopersmith, 2015, p. 17)
