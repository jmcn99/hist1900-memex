Coopersmith mentions that it is very common for technology to be envisioned years or decades ahead of their successful realization. This immediately had me think of a passage from [[@bushWeMayThink1945]], where he was [[envisioning new technologies]], many of which did eventually become reality, years or decades after he predicted them. This makes me think of how many technologies were correctly predicted, and how many of the future technologies we are currently predicting will be correct?
