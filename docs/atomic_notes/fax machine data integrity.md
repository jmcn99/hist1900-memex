Data integrity was also an issue with fax machines. Coopersmith gave examples of how these machines could occassionally mess up letters, making a sentence look like it had another meaning. "Eight decades later another English fax promoter promised, “The sender need not fear that ‘Mother-in-law dead hurry’ will be altered to ‘Mother-in-law dead Hurray,’ or something like that." ([[@coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015]], p.17), was a specific example he gave.

This relates to other communications technologies, such as recent digital data transfer, or as simple as a book.
