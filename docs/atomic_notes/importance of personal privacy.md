Personal privacy is something that everyone should strive for and respect, but not everyone does. For most people, personal privacy is not an act of self-preservation or safety, but more so an act of maintaining a private life, ensuring human dignity. However, many groups need privacy. These groups include journalists, government officials, and vulnerable users. To individuals dealing with classified documents, such as Edward Snowden himself, access to personal privacy could be a matter of life or death. 

While this type of person may not be the normal person, the work that these people do, which necessitates their need for privacy, impacts every single one of us. These are the people who disclose foreign news, act against corrupt corporations or individuals, or in Snowdenâ€™s case, act against their government. If not for these individuals who have stepped forward to disclose information, society would remain in the dark about the actions of corrupt corporations, individuals, and governments.
