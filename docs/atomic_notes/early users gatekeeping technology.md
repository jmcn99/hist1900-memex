Why do users of earlier technology not want it to become easily accessible? This seems like a trend when only a certain amount of tech savy users can use an early technology, they seem to gate keep it.

It would make sense, especially for a information hub like Gopher, that users would want the most possible users online, as to have access to the most amount of information on many different subjects.
