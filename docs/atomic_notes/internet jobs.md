The internet has created an entirely new way to work, and with that has created a massive amount of jobs. A study showed that the internet has created over seven million jobs, which is an impressive number. Another thing to think about is the amount of jobs that have been removed by the internet. Jobs relating to newspapers, travel agents, retails jobs have all been lost or decreased due to the availability and easy of access to these services on the internet.

Thinking about the rise of AI and incorperating this technology with physical tech, there is a large possibility to lose a high amount of manual labour jobs in the near future, IMO.
