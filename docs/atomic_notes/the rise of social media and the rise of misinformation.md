With the rise of social media, the rise of misinformation came as well. Now anyone had an outlet to say what they wanted without any concequences. Especially in the early, lawless days of the internet, you could basically say anyhting you wanted under a pseudonym and there would be no one caring enough to provide any concequences for this. 

This is prevelant now, with the idea of fake propoganda on the internet, or people just trying to cyberbully. This makes it very important to always take what you read on the internet with a cautious outlook. 

Another problem with this is children who have unsupervised access to the internet, which is becoming a recent trend due to the ease of access and the stress raising a child has on parents. This comes with children having access to inapproopriate content, possibly causing them harm.
