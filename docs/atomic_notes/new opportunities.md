This made me think of secondary job prospects / opportunities that emmerge from the popularity of a new technology. Coopersmith mentioned that the ability to send photographs would cause photography to be much more important in newspapers. Of course, this leads to opportunities within the newspaper space, as well as the faxing space, but what about the opportunities within photography? This surely will cause an increase in demand for photographers. This is a good example of how a new technology being popularized can cause demand for other technologies / professions.
