Lots of technology that has been unvieled and is now being used widely can be unintentionally blackbox, even if it is not designed that way. This can put some people at a disadvantage.

Take for example, the twitter algorithm which has recently become public. Even though it is the opposite of blackbox design, for most people they will still not be able to understand how it works, regardless of the source code being open for viewing or not. This can put specific people who are able to understand the algorithms at an advantage. In the twitter example, people who understand the algorithm can use that knowledge to boost their posts to a wider audience.

> “Several get the chronology wrong, placing the World Wide Web before the internet or expressing confusion about the invention of email. Others mention “tech wizards” or “geniuses” from Silicon Valley firms and university labs. No fewer than four students have simply written, “Bill Gates.”” (Driscoll, 2022, p. 1)
