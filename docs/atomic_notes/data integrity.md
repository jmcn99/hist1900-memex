Data integrity is something that is very important in the world of cybersecurity. This term means, for lack of a better explanation, that the data you are reading, or recieving in general, is the data you are intending to view. In cyberspace, the data you recieve on your device passes through many third parties, such as servers. This means that someone can change the data, or even replace it with a fake one as it passes through one of these third parties, and you would never know. 

The solution for this is *digital signatures.* This means, in a non technical sense, creating a signature that can be verfied with you as the owner, but cannot be recreated.
