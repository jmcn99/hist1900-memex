What is the definition of a book? This is a question that is very difficult to answer. Is a book the story it contains? Or the actual paper itself? There are many answers to this question, but there are many counter examples that will contradict those answers. 

"Books", or at least the mediums used to create books, have changed shape over many years and cultures. Going from stone tablets, to scrolls, to the codex, and to digitally printed, able to be displayed on many different mediums, which eventually become obsolete in the face of a newer, more useful medium for a book. 

for fun, here is chatGPT's answer to "what is a book?":

> A book can be considered a philosophical object in that it represents a physical manifestation of the human desire to understand the world and communicate ideas to others. Books serve as a tool for preserving and transmitting knowledge, culture, and values from one generation to the next. They provide a space for people to explore different perspectives, question assumptions, and expand their understanding of the world.
> 
>In this sense, a book can be seen as a window into the human experience, offering insights into our collective history, our shared hopes and fears, and our attempts to make sense of the world. Whether in the form of works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, or any other genre, books provide a space for us to engage with the world on a deep and meaningful level, to challenge our own beliefs and assumptions, and to discover new and previously unconsidered possibilities.
>
>Ultimately, the meaning and significance of a book can only be determined by the reader and the context in which it is read. A book may contain a single, definitive message, or it may hold many possible interpretations, each of which may be shaped by the reader's own experiences, beliefs, and cultural background. In this way, a book can be seen as a collaborative creation between the author and the reader, each of whom bring their own unique perspectives to the work, enriching its meaning and significance.
