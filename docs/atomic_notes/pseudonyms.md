Pseudonyms are an idea created to keep your online identity separate from your personal identity if you so choose, and also allowing you to have separate online identities. This is very important in the world of digital privacy, and likely influenced the massive increase in usage of early online digital forums. It provided a way to communicate while leaving your personal identity behind, and crafting a new one. 

This also allows for more negative aspects of the internet, as people can say what they want unfiltered without it being connected to them directly, but rather a pseudonym of them on the internet.
