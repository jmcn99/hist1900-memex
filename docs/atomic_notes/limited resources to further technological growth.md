-   One idea per note - but as complete as possible in your own words
-   Write as if you are writing for someone else. Use full sentences
-   Include sources in the note, but the note should be understood even if you don't know the context it was taken from. The note should **stand by itself**
-   Be precise, clear and brief.}

Tully's article on the Victorian Ecological Disaster and the Anotomy of an AI System article by Crawford and Joler detail how humanity is inclined to exploit the Earths limited resources when faced with the possibility of a great technological innovation.

Tully's example of this is gutta-percha sap. He details how the Percha tree went extinct due to the mass harvesting of the sap for use as insulation for telegraph cables. 

Crawford and Joler use lithium as an example, which is more in line with recent times. This is a resource that is currently being harvested on a mass scale, for use in batteries. If we run out of lithium, which we are on track to, it would be detrimental to the new age of technology.
