Recent technologies are very much [[blackbox]] oriented. I believe that this is due firstly to the complex hardware side, but mainly the complex software that goes is the backbone of their functionality. 

For example, neural networks / machine learning is a concept so difficult to understand, that the developers who work on these technologies have trouble fully understanding how it works. Therefore, the general public, unless they go out of their way to learn, is going to have a very minimal understanding. They ask the Amazon Echo what the weather is, and it answers, knowing their location and even what hours they would like to know the weather for.

>A brief command and a response is the most common form of engagement with this consumer voice-enabled AI device. But in this fleeting moment of interaction, a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization.
