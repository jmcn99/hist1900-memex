>“insights into how we might build healthier online communities that are more just, equitable, and inclusive.” (Driscoll, 2022, p. 1) 

Driscoll mentions how social media platforms emerged to make healthier online communities. I do not believe this is the case, regardless of the rules, social media is largely unhealthy. The unrealistic beauty standards that are pushed by these big corperations and its users are just one example.
