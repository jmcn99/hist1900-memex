>The Echo is but an ‘ear’ in the home: a disembodied listening agent that never shows its deep connections to remote systems.

Recent [[blackbox]] designed technologies also give way to [[digital privacy]] concerns. Because the user has no idea what is going on under the hood, they are vulnerable to being exploited by the company distrubiting the technologies, such as Amazon Echo. 

How would the user know that everytime they speak to the device, or even just speak around the device, the recordings of this interaction are not uploaded and sold to a third party, or taken and used by the government for [[surveillance]]?
