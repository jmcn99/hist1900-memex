> “He called in impersonating Radon one night, uploaded an EXE file, and said something like, "Here are the new menus you wanted." I trusted him and ran the file.” (Edwards, 2022, p. 1) 

This is a great example by the author of the human aspect of cybersecurity. No one hacked into his machine, or his network, yet they were still able to cause devestating harm to his computer, just because they tricked him. This shows another side of cybersecurity, the human side. Human error is something that will always exist, as long as humans are involved. Preventing this is something that can be learned, but trusting someone online is much more difficult than trusting someone in person.
