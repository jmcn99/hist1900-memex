This quote from Tully showcases how widely used gutta-percha was, and how it is incredible how it went to almost forgotten. Tully gives multiple examples of how most people in todays society, save for a few niche groups, don't even know what gutta-percha is. 

This point can expand upon the topic of [[recent technologies quickly become obsolete]], in showcasing that obsolete technologies can also mean building materials.
