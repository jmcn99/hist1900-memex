> “A less-fortunate company, eToys.com, got off to a promising start—its stock quadrupled on the day it went public in 1999—but then filed for Chapter 11 “The Internet and Social Media” bankruptcy in 2001 (Barnes, 2001).” (Publisher, 2016, p. 1) 

What went wrong with etoys? The stock quadroupled first opening day, and this was a great market. Think Toys-R-Us. The ease of use for parents to buy toys online is a great bussiness model, because it saves stressed and busy parents the time needed to go out and buy toys for their children. 

I wonder if this was caused by a failed bussiness plan or other outside factors.
