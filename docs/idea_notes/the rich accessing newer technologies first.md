>“telegrams were the "rich man's mail."(Müller, 2016, p. 512)

I feel like this is the case for every new technology, but they are usually brought to a point where they become very accessible. It is in the companies who develop these technologies interest to do so, because the more people using these technologies the more money they will make.

Examples of this are:
- Horses -> cars
- Landlines -> cell phones
- Big PCS -> laptops

All of the latter technologies were exclusive to the people who could afford a very large price tag, but now a days these are very accessible to most people in first world countries.
