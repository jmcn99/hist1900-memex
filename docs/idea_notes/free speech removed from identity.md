> “However, most influential aspects of the culture itself actually stemmed from anonymous communities.” (Allebach, 2020, p. 1)

 free speech removed from your identity creates people who will really speak what they think. free speech exists, but if you have outlandish thoughts than you will be shunned for them. people who can express these thoughts for 
 1. in a private space not associated with their IRL identity, and 
 2. in an almost echo chamber, such as on blogs that are tailed for this specific ideaology.
 with these two factors, people with outlandish idealogies are allowed to be supported, such as nazis and freedom fighters. they can find a community that agrees with them, where outsiders stay away.
