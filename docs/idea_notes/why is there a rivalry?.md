I question why this rivaly exists over telegraph cables exist, because everyone here is working towards a common goal, which is instantaneous global communications. It is in any one countries interest to have communication connections to every other country, for things such as trading and political communication. Max's memex has a good answer to this, displayed as an entry titled [imperialist internet](https://maxthebeast300.github.io/Hist1900memex/thoughts/atomicNotes/Imperialist_internet/).
