This is a great example of how [[recent technologies quickly become obsolete]], and how they can be replaced with such an amazing increase in speed. 

This example highlights the difference in speed when going from delivering message by horseback, or over ship, which could take days, or even months to reach their destination. This technology was replaced by electronic telegraphs, which were effectively instantaneous, changing the way the world was able to communicate with itself.
