> “Far from the original maximum inbox sizes of a few megabytes, today’s e-mail services, like Google’s Gmail service, generally provide gigabytes of free storage space.” (Publisher, 2016, p. 1) 

How do these services make any money in recent times? Looking at most mail providers, there are no ads anywhere in the service, and you are provided with many gigabytes worth of free storage.

[Melissas Memex](https://ladylovelace02.github.io/Hist1900memex/Community%20Run%20Internet/) has a good view on the way that the web should be centered around free services, rather than big corporations trying to make a buck.
