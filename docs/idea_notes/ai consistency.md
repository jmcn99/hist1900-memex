AI is a new age technology, that even within the past year has created a large shift in the way that we work. However, since this technology is trained off our own human made resources, how can we ensure that the data it is outputting is accurate?

If it were to be fed biased information, it would produce biased results. Because of this, it is incredibly important that we make sure the data that these models are being trained from are as non-biased as possible, but in this day and age, and with the amount of data needed, that is very difficult.
