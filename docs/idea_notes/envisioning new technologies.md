Bush's new ideas are very unique, and a lot of them have become reality. He envisions many different technologies that are similar to what we do have today. For example, Bush describes a camera that "a (photographer) of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut" [[@bushWeMayThink1945]]. Today, this could be seen as a GoPro. A GoPro is a device slightly larger than a walnut, in which the user wears it strapped to their forhead. Again accurate, the camera is always in focus, up until the point of the naked eye. However, modern day cameras are much better than the naked eye, which is an impressive feat of modern day technology.
