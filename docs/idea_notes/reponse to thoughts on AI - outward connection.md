I agree with Sophies take on AI. Lots of people have an inconsistent view on AI, often confusing it with AGI (Artificial General Intellegence). Artificial intellegence as we know it is not 'intellegence', but rather a large pool of data that the technology can use to make connections, and return results based on those connections. 

AI deepfake adult films are something that are incredibly scary and have the potential to ruin many careers, as they are just getting better as time goes on. We need regulations in place that give severe concequences to people who create and release this type of content, and make the reprocussions similar to that when an actual adult film gets released without the persons consent.

I somewhat disagree with Sophies thoughts on using AI to cheat. It is true, that AI is being used to cheat, but these people that are using it to cheat are going to cheat regardless if they have the technology or not. I believe that this type of technology, such as chatGPT should be viewed in a more constructive way, as it does provide an amazing tool to be used while doing school. For example, it can provide you a summarized version of an article if you don't have time to read the entire thing, or help you organize your thoughts surrounding an essay that you are writing. 

[Michael's Memex](https://themike92.github.io/memex-HIST1900/Thoughts/Internet/The%20implications%20of%20AI%20on%20todays%20Internet/) has great thoughts about the implications of AI on the modern internet.
