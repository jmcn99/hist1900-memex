“Instead of resetting it, I decided to just take it offline. I held no ceremony and shed no tears; it just felt like time to hang up the ol' BBS and move on.” (Edwards, 2022, p. 1) the loss of entire communities quickly. the internet showcases another side of technologies moving quickly and becoming obsolete, specifically digital technologies.
