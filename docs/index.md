## **opening remarks**

this memex is my attempt to tie together a history class with my interest in computer science. originally, when joining this class I figured it would be a more modern history of the internet, starting around the first 'actual' internet. soon, i discovered why this class is part of the history department, and not computer science. 

therefore, i decided to embrace it, and with this memex attempt to create the connections i originally enrolled in this class to discover. I have brought in article(s) from my other classes, such as my computer security course, in order to relate the required readings from this class to my other academic research. 

#### **current focus**

currently, i have found many relations and interests within **data integrity**. this interest was originally sparked, at the same time, by the [[@bookLab]] and by my intro to cybersecurity course. understanding *why* data integrity is important, how different mediums change the integrity of the same information, and what tools were being used (information aquired from this class) and what we are currently using (information aquired from other classes / outside resources) to ensure data integrity, is currently where my thoughts lie. 

for some reason, i have also taken a strong interest into **the definition of a book**, and relating it to computer science. maybe because books have become very digitilized recently? can you even digitalize a book? what even is [[the definition of a book]]?

also, i have more thoughts that i am interested into diving deeper on, like i have been on data integrity, but i am waiting until my first memex evaluation to begin. **i would like to know that i am on the right track so i can make the best possible connections.**

## **todo**

- start making connections about data security, a topic i would like to relate to this class
	- a large topic, so i would like to wait until i have my first memex evaluated before i begin making connections about it, so i know i'm on the right track. 
- for fun, i have started using some definitions from "chatGPT". this is something that has also been very prominant on my mind and a tool that has proved to be very useful.
	- i would like to find some articles about AI and relate it to the latter parts of this course.
- figure out if i'm writing my notes correctly
	- i would like to find ways to make my thoughts flow more naturally. i find myself looking for connections rather than fully engaging in the reading and letting the connections come to me after / during. 
- possibly look ahead at all the coming readings, and plan out some of my own in order to tailor what i'm reading and planning on reading to the direction i want my memex to go.
- find other students in my class i can collaborate with and share memex notes.
