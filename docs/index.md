# **joseph mcnamara's personal memex.**
---

## **opening remarks**

this memex is my attempt to tie together a history class with my interest in computer science. originally, when joining this class I figured it would be a more modern history of the internet, starting around the first 'actual' internet. soon, i discovered why this class is part of the history department, and not computer science. 

i decided to embrace it. with this memex i will attempt to create the connections i originally enrolled in this class to discover. I have brought in article(s) from my other classes, such as my computer security course, in order to relate the readings from this class to my other academic research. 

#### **current focus**

in this current iteration of my memex, i focused a lot on the development of the web as we know it today. covering topics from the rise and fall of gopher, to the economics of the internet and how companies are making money. i did keep the privacy approach, moving towards a focus on pseudonyms and how they can be used in social media and beyond.
