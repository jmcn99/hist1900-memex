# **joseph mcnamara's personal memex.**
---

## **opening remarks**

this memex is my attempt to tie together a history class with my interest in computer science. originally, when joining this class I figured it would be a more modern history of the internet, starting around the first 'actual' internet. soon, i discovered why this class is part of the history department, and not computer science. 

i decided to embrace it. with this memex i will attempt to create the connections i originally enrolled in this class to discover. I have brought in article(s) from my other classes, such as my computer security course, in order to relate the readings from this class to my other academic research. 

#### **current focus**

currently, i am focused on privacy. this iteration of my memex has been heavily influenced by the book that i have just finished reading, ***permanent record*** by **edward snowden**. i have been enjoying thinking about the connections between privacy and early telegraphy networks.

## **todo**

- tie in what i'm doing / reading into what the class is focusing on, rather than my own ideas. 
	- better yet, tie my own ideas into what the class is focusing on, so i am able to keep  a balance and motivation to continue.
- bring in more of my classmates memexes. (memi?)
