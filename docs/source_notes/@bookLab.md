### Summary & Key Take Aways

The book lab was very interesting. We began by having a discussion based around the question "what is a book?". This question took us almost in circles, where we kept contradicting ourselves and any time we came to a defintion of what a book was, there was a counter example of something that could be a book, and if so, would contradict the defintion. 

We spoke about the different ways "books" have been displayed throughout history and within different cultures, and different mediums and technologies have changed the way we view books. For example, we had stone tablets, and then scrolls, and then the codex, and now we have books stored digitally on our smartphones.

The topic of printing presses and making paper was also brought up. We spoke about how the printing press evolved, and the dangers that came with it.
