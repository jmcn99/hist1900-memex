### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article by Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler describes the way that we interact with Artificial Intellegence. This article uses the Amazon Echo as its medium when describing Artificial Intellegence, but also showcases multiple examples of recent usescases, such as TensorFlow. The device is shown as a map of human expereinces stored as mass data, and of resources from  the earth itself. 

The authors touch on many ideas surrounding AI, such as the labor and resources it takes in order to not only build these devices, but most electronic devices that we use today. They explain the terrible effects that gathering these limited resources have on our natural ecosystem, however they do not provide any ideas to solve this.
