### Summary & Key Take Aways

Jonathan Coopersmith writes about the history and origin of the fax machine, as well as it's upbringing and downfall. In the first chapter, he explains different key characters that were involved with the creation of technology that preceded the fax machine, such as the electrochemical telegraph. The legal and moral battles between these characters were also detailed, such as the legal fight in American between Bain and Morse. Furthermore, Coopersmith went into great detail on the inner workings of these different machines, and how they changed and evolved over time.

>> made me think of secondary job prospects that emmerge from new inventions. Of course, newspaper sales would rise, fax machine sales would rise, but a secondary effect of this would be that there is an high demand for photographers. It may be helpful to look for this type of opportunity, as there are thousands of people trying to invent new fax machines, but maybe not as many for photography.
