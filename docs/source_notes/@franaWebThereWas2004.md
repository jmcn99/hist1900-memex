### Summary & Key Take Aways

Before the Web There Was Gopher is an Article by Philip L. Frama of the Charles Babbage Institude detailing the technical details of a pre World Wide Web protocol titled Gopher, as well as its quick rise and fall to the WWW. Frama explains the inner workings of Gopher, from its hierchy file system directories, to the ease of creater new servers (or gophers) to host your own information from. The main point of the article was to detail how quickly Gopher rose, and the struggles it faced causing it to quickly be made obsolete by the web as we know it today. This article brough to light a new aspect of the web which I was unaware of, and provided lots of thought on what Gopher could have done to stay relevant.
