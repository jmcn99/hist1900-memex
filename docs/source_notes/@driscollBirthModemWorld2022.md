### Summary & Key Take Aways

Driscoll's Birth of the Modem World is a take on explaining the history of the internet by taking a deep look at BBSs or Bulletin Board Systems, accesed via dial up modems. The author explains how these bulletin boards were used by a community to create different boards for computer hobiests originally, but expanded into news, stock prices, and other information. These BB systems cost money for long distance dial-up charges, so systems hosted in a certain geographical area usually had a userbase comprised of people also in the geographical area, making it a popular way to physically meet others with similar interests.
