### Summary & Key Take Aways

Nathan Allebach's article "A Brief History of Internet Culture and How Everything Became Absurd" is an interesting look into the history of social media and the cultures that festered within them. He covers how sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram emmerged from communities like MySpace, 4Chan and Reddit, as well as the predecesors to those sites. He depicts the *deep internet*, as spaces where anonymity was the standard, allowing users free speech without their speech being associated to their identity. This article was very intersting, and gave an insite into how social media has influences society today, in good ways and bad.
