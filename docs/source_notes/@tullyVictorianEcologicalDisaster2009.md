### Summary & Key Take Aways

Tully's article explains the incredible popularity of Gutta-percha, a latex like substance extracted from Malaysian Percha trees. This substance was used in the early construction of telegraph cable, to insulate it as well as provide it water resistence for use in the ocean. Tully details the extreme harvesting of this resource, and how it society was incredibly close to completely draining this limited resource from the earth.
