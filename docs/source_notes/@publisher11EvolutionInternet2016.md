### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article gives a history of the internet as we know it today, starting in around the 70s going over packet switching, and distributed networks. It covers ideas around the early internet, with technologies like ARPANET. It gave an overview of hypertext, which was the technology uysed on the early web. I found it intersting that it did not mention Gopher, as referenced in [[1-inbox/@franaWebThereWas2004|Before the Web There Was Gopher]]. It was an intersting insite into the technological and economical growth of the internet.
