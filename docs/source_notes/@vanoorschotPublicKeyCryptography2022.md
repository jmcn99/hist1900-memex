### Note

I brought this article in because I thought it related to a couple thoughts that I have been having. Firstly and foremost, data integrity. How do we ensure that the data we are reading is what we think we are reading? This was similar to [[book consistency]]. 

Secondly, I thought about how technologies becoming obsolete is a trend that is happening often in recent societies. However, this is not limited to physical technologies. Digital technologies and methods are also being quickly taken over by a 'better version'.

Lastly, I would like to tie my memex together with aspects of Computer Science, because that is what I am interested in.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article details the history and impacts that Diffie and Hellmans discovery of public key cryptography had on the development of secure communication. van Oorschot details many examples of ideas that Diffie and Hellman had prior to their discovery, as well as the technologies that were able to be created after the discovery. Examples of these technologies include e-commerce, specifically the ability to send your credit card info securely over the internet, as well as simple tasks such as secure messaging channels, like WhatsApp.
