this is my [personal memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) for carleton universities [HIST1900](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/) taught by shawn graham.

it can be seen as a linkage between the history aspects of computing taught in this course and the computing aspects of what i learn in my other courses and work to do with computer science.
